# Rock-mood-detector
The Rock Mood Detector is a creative and humorous Python-based desktop app that detects the "mood" of a rock based on a randomly selected image or interaction. Of course, rocks don’t have real emotions—but this project imagines they do, adding a playful twist using randomized mood responses.
